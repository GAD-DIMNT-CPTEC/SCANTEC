This directory should contain very basic sanity tests which
must be passed before anything else in the framework is even
attempted to be compiled or run.

This might include, but is not limited to:

interlanguage issues - passing back and forth strings
                     - ensuring word sizes in F90 and C++ match
                     - ensuring a F90 program calling C++ can be linked
                     - ensuring a C++ program calling F90 can be linked

MPI - that the proper mpi interfaces are available and executables
      which use them can be linked

threading - that a program using threads can be linked

LAPACK - that a program calling LAPACK can be linked

netCDF - that a program calling netCDF can be linked
