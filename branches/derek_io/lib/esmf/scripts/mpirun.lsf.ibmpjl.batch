# This script abides to the ESMF script rules for executing the bundled test 
# and example applications.
#
# 1) <this_script> -np N prog
#    runs N copies of executable "prog" in parallel. The script must hide all
#    of the system specific details, such as going through a queueing system
#    and/or calling a system specific mpirun script with modified arguments.
#
# 2) The output of the script must be written to a file named "prog".stdout and
#    it must contain the combination of stdout and stderr output of the
#    execution.
#
# 3) The script must block, i.e. _not_ return, until the output described in #2
#    has become accessible.
#
# To access this script set environment variable ESMF_MPIRUN=<this_script> in
# your shell before executing any of the ESMF run targets or targets that 
# call run targets indirectly, such as the all_tests.

# This script submits a job through LSF and then interfaces with
# IBM's mpirun.lsf which is IBM's unified PJL (parallel job launcher)
# out of an LSF session for lammpi, mpich_gm, poe, and mpichp4
# AIX and IBM/Linux clusters.
# This script runs jobs on the batch queue not the interactive queue.
