This directory contains three executables that make up an MPMD tool chain for use on OSF1 alpha systems (such as the halem system at NCCS).


INSTALLATION
------------

env INSTALLDIR="your-install-location" gmake


USEAGE
======

The chain is as follows:

mpimpmdrun -> pprun -> pprunlaunch

There are two entry points for using this tool chain. The mpimpmdrun entry point allows to be called similar to how the MPI standard's mpiexec suggests for MPMD, i.e. 

mpimpmdrun -np 1 ./a.out : -np 1 ./b.out : -np ......

The pprun entry point utilizes a procfile where each line lists the number of processes and the executable name. mpimpmdrun produces such a procfile and calls pprun.

pprun the uses RMS' prun command to start pprunlaunch on each process and execute the correct executable.

Optional prun arguments to mpimpmdrun and pprun must be specified first.
