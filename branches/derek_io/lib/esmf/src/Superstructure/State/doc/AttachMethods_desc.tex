%\subsection{Description}

ESMF data types, such as Fields, FieldBundles, Arrays and ArrayBundles, are used
to exchange data between Components through States. In the simplest
scenario the producer Component or Coupler can compute the full data set
required by the consumer Component. However, memory constraints or otherwise
the nature of the algorithm, may require that the final calculation be
performed right before the data is consumed. 

ESMF provides the concept of Attachable Methods that allows a producer 
component to associate user defined methods with the data objects it provides.
The final calculation, while defined by the producer Component, is deferred
until the consumer Component requires its execution.

The current implementation of Attachable Methods is limited to the ESMF State
class. States are a general container class for Fields, FieldBundles, Arrays
and ArrayBundles. States provide the most general interface to Attachable
Methods.
