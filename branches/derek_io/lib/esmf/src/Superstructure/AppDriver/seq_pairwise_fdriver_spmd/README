This directory contains the starting files needed to build an ESMF
Application with: sequential execution, a pairwise Coupler Component,
a main program in Fortran, and the same executable on each
computational node (SPMD).


To compile as-is for testing, run 'gmake' in this directory.
The resulting skeleton and driver files should produce an executable
which can be run and will output messages to the log describing
each stage of execution.


To use these files as a basis for a real application begin by copying
them to another directory.  Then edit the child Coupler and Gridded
Component Template files to reflect the actual data passed between
components and the computations necessary.  If needed, edit the Parent
Gridded Component file.  The AppDriver file should be useable for
simple applications without changes.
