\subsection{Introduction}

This section describes the organization of a
demonstation program which uses the ESMF Framework,
including use of both the 
Superstructure and Infrastructure.

\subsection{ESMF\_COUPLED\_FLOW Description}
 
The {\tt ESMF\_COUPLED\_FLOW} application is comprised of two ESMF 
{\tt Gridded Components} and a {\tt Coupler Component}.  
The first {\tt Gridded Component}, {\tt FlowSolver}, solves the compressible 
time-dependent fluid flow equations.  The algorithm 
applies an explicit solution technique to a staggered, Arakawa C igrid 
that is cartesian and uniform.  State variables, including density, 
pressure, viscosity and temperature, are located at cell-centers, while 
velocities are located at cell faces.  This component is initialized 
with a steady-state, one-dimensional flow.  The second {\tt Gridded 
Component}, {\tt Injector}, injects fluid into the first normal to the 
flow along 
one of the boundaries.  The injected fluid can have arbitrary velocity, 
temperature, density and duration, effectively setting some of 
the boundary conditions for the first component.  The {\tt FlowSolver} and 
{\tt Injector Components} sit on different cartesian igrids.  The
{\tt Coupler Component} redistributes boundary condition data from 
the {\tt Injector} to the {\tt FlowSolver}.
